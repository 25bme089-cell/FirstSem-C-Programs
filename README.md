# First Semester C Programs

This repository contains a collection of C programs written during my first semester of Mechanical Engineering.  
It serves as both a learning archive and a portfolio of foundational programming concepts.

## 📂 Contents
- Basic input/output
- Conditional statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and strings
- Functions and recursion
- File handling basics
- Structures

Each file may contain multiple programs stored as commented blocks.  
Use **Ctrl + /** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + /** (Mac) in VS Code to toggle comments and run specific blocks.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Programs

### ▶️ Option 1: Run in VS Code (with GCC)
1. Install [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (Windows) or GCC (`sudo apt install build-essential` on Linux).
2. Open the repo folder in VS Code.
3. Select the block of code you want to run → **Ctrl + /** to uncomment.
4. Compile and run in the terminal:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output   # Linux/macOS
   output.exe # Windows

### ▶️ Option 2: Run in Code::Blocks
1. Open Code::Blocks IDE.
2. Create a new project or open an existing `.c` file from this repo.
3. Uncomment the block you want to run (Ctrl + /).
4. Press **Build and Run (F9)**.

### ▶️ Option 3: Run in Turbo C (legacy)
1. Open Turbo C IDE.
2. Load the `.c` file from this repo.
3. Uncomment the block you want to run.
4. Compile with **Alt + F9**.
5. Run with **Ctrl + F9**.
